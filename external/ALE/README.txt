Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy all the image and ground truth files into the folders set up in dataset.cpp of chosen
data set and run it. By default no command line parameters are necessary.

Current version contains slightly better features than the ones published, thus should lead to
a slightly better performance than reported. Examples of use of other methods in the library are
shown (but not tuned) in the corel data set class. For an import of features, segmentations,
potentials or object detections from other executable, use the Dummy classes provided.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current version contains a project file for Visual Studio in MS Windows and a makefile for
linux compiler g++. Windows version is self-contained, linux requires DevIL library to be
installed. You can install it in Ubuntu od Debian distributions by typing : 
"sudo apt-get install libdevil-dev" or in Suse or ReHat distributions using command
"yum install libdevil-dev". For other linux version you probably know what to do:). The code
has been tested in Kubuntu and RedHat. If there are any problems in other distributions, please
report the problem.
